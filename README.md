## Hey everyone, this is the repository I created on Sep 8th, 2018. Mainly used it for practicing Python

Main book I may look for is 'Elements of Programming Interviews in Python',
When I was hunting for jobs, I mainly use 'Elements of Programming Interview in Java', it's very nice, so I believe this one should also be wonderful.

So, let's do it from today and see how far we can get.
